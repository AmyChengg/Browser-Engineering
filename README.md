# Browser-Engineering
I created a web browser using Python during the University of Washington course, CSE493X [Web Browser Engineering](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse493x/24sp/).
My code is based on the online textbook, [Web Browser Engineering by Pavel Panchekha & Chris Harrelson](https://browser.engineering/).
