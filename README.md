# Browser-Engineering
I created a web browser using Python during the University of Washington course, CSE493X, [Web Browser Engineering](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse493x/24sp/).
My code is based on each chapter of the online textbook, [Web Browser Engineering by Pavel Panchekha & Chris Harrelson](https://browser.engineering/), from Chapter 1 to Chapter 10.
